# Create a custom route that takes a parameter of a single word. That route should take us to an action where we look through items to see if any of the items have that word in the description (doesnâ€™t have to be a full match, case-insensitive). The action will render json of all the users that have items that fit that criterion. If there is no match render json that says so.
